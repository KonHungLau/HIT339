## Anyone for Tennis

Dear E-Corp,

We need a web-based application that will fulfill our in-house and membership needs.

Currently we run two or three databases, one for coaches, one for schedules and one for membership, and we wish to integrate them all into one web-based application.
<br></br>
Members need to:
1. View the schedules with who is coaching them at any time from the website
2. View coach profiles from a list, and from the schedule details.
3. Create an account so that we can email them of upcoming specials
4. Enroll in a scheduled item before the scheduled date once they have logged in

Members should not see anything else!
<br></br>
Coaches need to be able to log in and:
1. Create/Edit a profile with a brief biography
2. See their upcoming schedules
3. See their enrolled members for each schedule

Coaches should not see anything else!
<br></br>
Admin needs to be able to log in and:
1. Create schedules with event-name, date, location and coach
2. Match coaches with schedules
3. View all membership in a list
 
Admin should see the lot.
<br></br>
Like I said, we already have the databases. Our IT technician will send you the details.

We need to utilise our existing data!We want a web-based application because of the accessibility.

If it's possible, can you make it work on my mobile phone???

Thanks!
<br></br>
Jim and Joan,
Your friends at Anyone for Tennis
